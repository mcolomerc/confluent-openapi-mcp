echo "🛡️  Security Features Demonstrated:"
echo "  • Regex-based pattern matching (fast, built-in)"
echo "  • Multiple severity levels (low, medium, high)"
echo "  • Comprehensive attack vector coverage"
echo "  • Real-time input validation"
echo

echo "🚀 Optional LLM Enhancement:"
echo "  • Run './scripts/setup-llm-detection.sh' for AI-powered detection"
echo "  • Provides context-aware analysis beyond pattern matching"
echo "  • Catches novel attack vectors not covered by regex"
echo "  • Adds confidence scoring and detailed explanations"
echo

echo "🔧 Configuration:"
echo "  • Edit .env file to enable LLM detection"
echo "  • Set LLM_DETECTION_ENABLED=true"
echo "  • Configure LLM_DETECTION_URL and model"
echo

echo "📖 For complete documentation:"
