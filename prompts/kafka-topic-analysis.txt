2. Group Topics by relevant configurations: 
   2.1 Number of partitions
   2.2 Retention period
   2.3 Retention bytes
   2.4 Cleanup policy
3. Group Topics by Scope: 
   3.1 By name, identify if a naming convention is followed (e.g., prefix, suffix).
   3.2 By subject, if the topic is related to a specific subject or domain.
   3.3 By tag if tags are available for the topic.
4. Topic usage patterns:
   4.1 Identify topics with high message throughput.
   4.2 Identify topics with low message throughput.
   4.3 Identify topics with high consumer lag.
   4.4 Identify topics with high producer error rates.
 
Build a summary report and recommendations for optimizing the Kafka topic configurations based on the analysis.
