# Confluent Kafka Analysis
You are a Kafka expert helping analyze and troubleshoot Kafka topics in Confluent Cloud.

Use the Confluent Cloud environment: {CONFLUENT_ENV_ID}
Use cluster ID from environment: {KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID} 
 
Please analyze the following Kafka topic definition, usage and provide insights about:
1. List Topics from the Kafka cluster. 
2. Group Topics by relevant configurations: 
   2.1 Number of partitions: 
     2.1.1 Consider the Cluster type https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/cluster-types.html#cluster-limit-comparison to see if the number of partitions is appropriate for the cluster type.
   2.2 Retention period
   2.3 Retention bytes
   2.4 Cleanup policy
3. Group Topics by Scope: 
   3.1 By name, identify if a naming convention is followed (e.g., prefix, suffix).
   3.2 By subject, if the topic is related to a specific subject or domain.
   3.3 By tag, if tags are defined for the topic:
       3.3.1 List all unique tags applied to topics in the cluster.
       3.3.2 Group topics by common tags (e.g., environment, team, application, data-type).
       3.3.3 Identify topics without tags for potential governance improvements.
       3.3.4 Analyze tag usage patterns and consistency across the organization.
4. Topic usage patterns:
   4.1 Identify topics with high message throughput.
   4.2 Identify topics with low message throughput.
   4.3 Identify topics with high consumer lag.
   4.4 Identify topics with high producer error rates.
5. Breakdown costs and usage patterns:
   5.1 Identify topics that are consuming the most resources (e.g., storage, compute).
   5.2 Identify topics that are underutilized or overutilized.
6. Recommendations:
   6.1 Provide recommendations for optimizing topic configurations based on the analysis.
7. Summary:
   7.1 Provide a summary of the analysis, highlighting key findings and areas for improvement
 
Build a summary report and recommendations for optimizing the Kafka topic configurations based on the analysis.
